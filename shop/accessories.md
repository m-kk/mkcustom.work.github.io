### Aillio Bullet R1 Bean Deflector

![Aillio Bullet R1 Bean Deflector](assets/img/shop/bean-deflector-hero.jpg){: .shadow }
_Heavy-duty ABS bean deflector eliminating bean scatter during cooling tray dumps_

#### The Problem
Every home roaster with an Aillio Bullet R1 V2 knows the frustration: beans scatter across the counter during the dump to the cooling tray. One or two beans per batch adds up to significant loss over hundreds of roasts—not to mention the cleanup hassle.

#### The Solution
A precision-engineered bean deflector that channels every bean exactly where it belongs. Built with premium Polymaker PolyLite ABS for superior heat resistance, impact strength, and long-term durability.

#### Key Features

✅ **Perfect Fit for Aillio Bullet R1 V2**  
Drop-in installation using two existing faceplate screws. No drilling, no modifications, no permanent changes to your roaster.

✅ **Heavy-Duty Construction**  
Over-engineered with 3mm wall thickness. Made with Polymaker PolyLite ABS—a name-brand, engineering-grade material chosen specifically for:
- High-temperature resistance
- Superior impact strength for repeated bean dumps
- Chemical resistance to oils and cleaning agents
- Long-term dimensional stability under thermal cycling

✅ **Professional-Grade Manufacturing**  
Dimensional accuracy within ±0.03mm ensures reliable mounting and consistent performance across production runs. 40% gyroid infill provides optimal strength-to-weight ratio.

✅ **Customization Available**  
Standard colors: black (matte) or green (satin). Other colors available on request with +1 day lead time.

#### Technical Specifications

| Specification | Detail |
|---------------|--------|
| **Material** | Polymaker PolyLite ABS |
| **Compatibility** | Aillio Bullet R1 V2 coffee roaster |
| **Mounting** | Two existing faceplate screws (included with roaster) |
| **Wall Thickness** | 3mm |
| **Print Layer Height** | 0.2mm |
| **Infill Density** | 40% (gyroid pattern) |
| **Weight** | 69g |
| **Dimensional Tolerance** | ±0.03mm |
| **Standard Colors** | Black, Green |
| **Installation Time** | <3 minutes |

#### Why Premium ABS?

Many 3D-printed roaster accessories use generic filament of unknown quality. Under repeated thermal cycling and physical stress, inferior materials warp, crack, or degrade within months.

**Polymaker PolyLite ABS** is different:
- Engineered-grade formulation with consistent mechanical properties
- Superior heat deflection temperature vs. PLA or cheap ABS
- Lower moisture absorption maintains dimensional accuracy over time
- Proven track record in demanding functional applications

This isn't just a "3D printed part"—it's a precision-manufactured component built to perform batch after batch.

#### Installation Instructions

1. **Remove existing screws**: Locate the two 3mm hex head screws on the Bullet R1 faceplate near the dump chute
2. **Position deflector**: Align mounting holes with existing screw locations
3. **Reinstall screws**: Hand-tighten screws—**do NOT overtighten** (finger-tight plus 1/4 turn is sufficient)
4. **Test fit**: Gently press deflector to verify secure mounting

**Installation time:** <3 minutes  
**Tools required:** 3mm Allen screwdriver (provided with your Bullet), or any 3mm Allen wrench

#### Care & Maintenance

- **Cleaning**: Wipe with damp cloth after roasting sessions. Avoid abrasive scrubbing or harsh chemicals
- **Storage**: Room temperature, away from direct sunlight when not in use
- **Inspection**: Periodically check mounting screws for tightness (thermal expansion/contraction may cause gradual loosening)

#### Pricing & Availability

**$20** + shipping

## Design Philosophy

Every product in this catalog is built on three principles:

1. **Solve real problems**: No solutions looking for problems. Each accessory addresses a specific workflow pain point identified through hundreds of roasting hours.

2. **Premium materials only**: Engineering-grade materials with documented thermal, mechanical, and chemical properties. No generic commodity filaments.

3. **Precision manufacturing**: Dimensional accuracy, consistent quality control, and rigorous testing. Professional-grade results, not hobby-level approximations.
