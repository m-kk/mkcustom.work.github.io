## How Custom Orders Work

### 1. Tell Me What You Need

**Email:** [matt@mkcustom.work](mailto:matt@mkcustom.work?subject=Custom%20Design%20Request)

**Include as much detail as possible:**
- **Problem you're solving** - What are you trying to organize, hold, or fix?
- **Measurements** - Dimensions of the space or item (critical for fit)
- **Photos** - Pictures of the area or items help immensely
- **Material preference** - Or ask for my recommendation
- **Quantity** - How many units do you need?
- **Timeline** - Any deadline or rush needs?

**Pro tip:** The more specific you are, the faster I can design and quote.

---

### 2. I'll Design & Send Quote

**Within 24-48 hours, you'll receive:**
- 3D model preview (rendered image or simple mockup)
- Material recommendation based on use case
- Quote breakdown (design time + printing cost)
- Estimated timeline

**Typical pricing:**
- **Simple modifications** (resize, add mounting holes): $15-25
- **New functional designs** (organizers, holders): $30-50
- **Complex custom parts** (multi-piece, precise fit): $50-75+

**Quote includes:**
- Design work
- Test print (if needed for fit verification)
- Final production print(s)
- Standard finishing

---

### 3. Approval & Payment

Once you approve:
- Invoice sent via email
- Payment accepted: PayPal, Venmo, Zelle
- Design work begins immediately upon payment

---

### 4. Design, Test, Ship

**My process:**
1. **Design** in CAD software (Fusion 360)
2. **Test print** for complex or precise-fit parts
3. **Send preview** for final approval (if significant design)
4. **Production print** with your chosen material/color
5. **Quality check** and finishing
6. **Ship** within 3-5 business days of approval

**You'll receive:**
- Finished printed part(s)
- Care instructions (if applicable)
- STL file (yours to keep for personal reprints)

---

---

## Material Selection for Custom Parts

### Choose Based on Use:

**PETG** - Most custom functional parts
- Strong, impact-resistant
- Indoor/outdoor (not direct UV long-term)
- Heat-resistant to 70°C
- Best for: Daily-use organizers, tool holders, anything mechanical

**PLA** - Decorative or light-duty
- Great surface finish
- Eco-friendly (biodegradable)
- Easiest to print (fewer issues)
- Best for: Display items, aesthetic pieces, prototypes

**ABS** - Industrial applications
- Very tough and durable
- Heat-resistant to 80°C
- Can be smoothed with acetone
- Best for: Automotive parts, enclosures, high-stress items

**ASA** - Outdoor & extreme conditions
- UV-stable (won't degrade in sun)
- Weatherproof
- Heat-resistant to 95°C
- Best for: Outdoor mounts, garden tools, car parts

**Not sure?** I'll recommend based on your use case.

## Pricing Guide

### Design Complexity Tiers:

**Simple** ($15-25)
- Modifications to existing designs
- Basic shapes with few features
- Resize or adapt catalog item
- Examples: Wider cable clip, taller pen holder

**Medium** ($30-50)
- New functional designs
- Multiple features/compartments
- Mounting considerations
- Examples: Custom drawer organizer, specific tool holder

**Complex** ($50-75+)
- Precise tolerances required
- Multi-piece assemblies
- Moving parts or threads
- Intricate geometries
- Examples: Replacement parts, mechanical fixtures, enclosures

**Print cost** added separately based on:
- Material used (calculated by weight)
- Print time
- Quantity

**Total typical range:** $25-75 for most custom projects (design + printing)

---

## Rush Orders

**Standard timeline:** 3-5 business days from approval to shipping

**Rush available:**
- **2-day rush:** +$25
- **Next-day rush:** +$50

**Note:** Rush only applies to print/ship time, not initial design phase.

Contact before ordering if you have a hard deadline.

---

## Design Ownership & Files

**What you get:**
- Physical printed part(s)
- STL file for personal use (reprint at home or elsewhere)

**What I retain:**
- Right to sell similar designs in catalog (unless exclusivity purchased)
- Portfolio use (photos of completed work)

**Exclusivity available:**
- One-time fee: +$100-250 depending on complexity

## Measurements Matter

**For best results, provide:**

**Calipers** (ideal):
- Digital calipers give 0.01mm precision
- Critical for replacement parts

**Ruler/tape measure** (good):
- Works for most organizers and holders
- Measure to nearest 1/8"

**Photos with scale** (helpful):
- Include a ruler, coin, or common object in photo
- Multiple angles

**Tracings** (sometimes useful):
- Trace outline on paper
- Note thickness or depth separately

**Bonus points:** Send me the thing (for replacement parts)—I'll measure, design, print, return with original.

---

## What I Can't Do

**To set expectations:**

- ❌ Medical devices or FDA-regulated items
- ❌ Weapons, weapon parts, or accessories
- ❌ Copyrighted/trademarked designs without proof of license
- ❌ Parts for critical safety applications (car brakes, climbing gear, etc.)
- ❌ Food-contact items (3D printed parts aren't food-safe due to layer gaps)

**If unsure, ask**—I'm happy to discuss whether your project is feasible.

---

## Bulk Custom Orders

**Need multiples?**

Ordering 10+ units of a custom design gets volume pricing:
- **10-24 units:** 10% discount
- **25-49 units:** 15% discount
- **50+ units:** 20% discount (contact for quote)

**Lead time:** Adjusted based on quantity (discuss during quoting)

## Questions Before Ordering?

**Common questions:**

**Q: Can you design from a sketch?**  
A: Yes! Hand-drawn sketches with dimensions work great.

**Q: What if it doesn't fit?**  
A: Send measurements first—I'll design to spec. If there's a design error, I'll reprint free.

**Q: Can I modify the design later?**  
A: Yes, revisions are $15-25 depending on complexity.

**Q: Do you ship the STL file first?**  
A: No—STL provided after physical part ships (ensures quality control).

**Q: Can I print it myself if I have a printer?**  
A: Yes! STL-only option available for $15-40 (design fee, no printing).

**Q: What colors are available?**  
A: Standard stock colors, or special order custom color (2-3 day lead time, no extra charge).
