# Functional Design, Perfectly Printed

Welcome to mkcustom.work! This is where practical problems meet custom 3D printing solutions. Designed for function, printed with precision, made in Chicago.

## What I Make

I create 3D printed solutions for real-world organization, tool optimization, and everyday frustrations. If it makes your workspace cleaner, your tools more accessible, or your daily routine smoother, I probably print it.

## Materials & Applications

I work with four primary materials, chosen for the right job:

### **PETG** (Functional & Durable)
- **Best for:** Daily-use items, mechanical parts, anything that needs flex resistance
- **Properties:** Strong, impact-resistant, moisture-resistant
- **Common uses:** Tool holders, cable management, organizers

### **PLA** (Aesthetic & Eco-Friendly)
- **Best for:** Decorative items, prototypes, low-stress applications  
- **Properties:** Easy to print, great surface finish, biodegradable
- **Common uses:** Desk accessories, planters, display items

### **ABS** (Industrial Strength)
- **Best for:** Parts needing high durability and some heat resistance
- **Properties:** Tough, heat-resistant (up to 80Â°C), solvent-weldable
- **Common uses:** Automotive parts, enclosures, functional prototypes

### **ASA** (Outdoor & Heat Resistant)
- **Best for:** Outdoor use, UV exposure, high-temperature applications
- **Properties:** UV-stable, weather-resistant, heat-resistant (up to 95Â°C)
- **Common uses:** Garden tools, outdoor mounts, car accessories

## How Custom Orders Work

### 1. **Tell Me What You Need**
Send an email to [matt@mkcustom.work](mailto:matt@mkcustom.work) with:
- Description of the problem you're solving
- Measurements (if applicable)
- Photos of the space/item (helps immensely)
- Material preference (or ask for recommendation)

### 2. **I'll Design & Quote**
I'll create a custom design or adapt an existing one:
- 3D model preview sent for approval
- Quote based on material, print time, complexity
- Typical range: $15â€“$75 for most custom pieces

### 3. **Print & Ship**
Once approved:
- Print with your chosen material and color
- Quality check and finishing
- Ship within 3â€“5 business days

## Quality Standards

Every print meets these criteria:

âœ“ **Precision:** 0.2mm layer resolution standard 
âœ“ **Strength:** Proper infill density for application (15%â€“100% depending on use)  
âœ“ **Finish:** Clean support removal, light sanding where needed  
âœ“ **Testing:** Functional parts are test-fitted before shipping  
âœ“ **Packaging:** Secure packaging to prevent shipping damage

## Pricing & Turnaround

**Stock designs:** $12â€“$35 (depending on size/material)  
**Custom designs:** $25â€“$75+ (includes design time + printing)  
**Bulk orders:** Volume discounts available
